        Enrollment Process and Timeline for 2014-2015 
        </span>
        <p>If applications exceed available spots, a lottery will be held.  To be eligible for the Lottery, please apply by February 28, 2014. <br /><br />
            The school will begin accepting Applications for Enrollment Consideration starting December 1, 2013. Applications postmarked or received via email by February 28, 2014 will be entered in the Lottery. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The number of students applying that have documented prior Montessori experience will be counted. 
                <ul>
                    <li>The desired ratio of students with prior Montessori experience to those without Montessori experience is 4:1. This ratio will be for each grade 1-3. </li>
                    <li>If the number of students with Montessori experience is greater than the desired 4:1 ratio in any grade level, a lottery will be conducted to place those children in available slots.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The number of students applying without prior Montessori experience will be counted. 
                <ul>
                    <li>The goal for available slots open to children without prior Montessori experience is to have one child without Montessori experience for every four children with it.</li>
                    <li>A lottery will be conducted to fill slots for children without prior Montessori experience.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Families will be notified of their child's placement after the lottery is drawn.</li>
            <li>Waiting lists will be created in the order the results are pulled from the lottery.</li>
            <li>Waiting lists will be maintained through the school year.</li>
            <li>Students on the waiting list will continue to be listed until they are placed or withdraw. </li>
        </ul>

        <span class="SAPMSSubHeader">AFTER February 28, 2014 </span>

        <p>
            After the lottery, openings will continue to be filled in the order of the waiting list. Application received after February 28 will be added to the waiting list in the order they are received. It is only after the lottery that the waiting list slots are filled on a first come, first served basis. 
        </p>

        <span class="SAPMSHeader">Enrollment and Admissions Policies </span>
            <p>The goals of SAPMS’s admissions policy are: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>To attract, enroll, and retain a broad spectrum of students that represents the rich diversity existing in the District and</li>
                <li>to provide for classroom growth consistent with an authentic Montessori education.</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
To maintain the Montessori philosophy in the classroom, SAPMS limits the number of students who do not have previous Montessori. If the number of applicants exceeds capacity, SAPMS gives preference to those children with previous Montessori experience. The desired ratio is four children with Montessori experience for every one child without Montessori experience.
            <br /><br />
SAPMS wishes to grow the classes such that a majority of the students have previous Montessori education. This allows minimal disruption to children who will remain in the same classroom for the three-year cycle. 
            </p>

<span class="SAPMSSubHeader">Preference for Children with Prior Montessori Experience </span>
        <p>
Many public schools implementing Montessori programs struggle with admission criteria. Experience shows it can be challenging for children to transition into a Montessori-style teaching method if they are older and have become more accustomed to the more traditional educational approach. 
            <br /><br />
Montessori classes work very differently depending on the percentage of children with Montessori experience. Some children without Montessori preschool experience adapt easily to expectations in the Montessori elementary class and some do not. 
            <br /><br />
When children who cannot work independently are in the minority, the teacher can focus attention, use older children as tutors, and so on. When this group makes up the majority of the class, Montessori practices involving free choice for major portions of the day are hard to implement, at least early in the school year.
            <br /><br />
SAPMS will limit the number of students who do not have previous Montessori experience as a means to maintaining the Montessori philosophy. The School will attempt to keep a ratio of four children with Montessori experience for every one child without Montessori experience in each classroom. Montessori teachers have observed that having a higher percentage of new students without previous Montessori experience in a class can make the class more difficult to normalize according the Dr. Montessori’s definition of the term.
            </p>

<span class="SAPMSSubHeader">Normalization </span>
        <p>
In the Montessori classroom the term normalized refers to special characteristics that Maria Montessori observed when children were allowed to work freely in a prepared environment. The North American Montessori Teacher’s Association describes it as follows:
            <br /><br />
Dr. Montessori observed that when children are allowed freedom in an environment suited to their needs, they blossom. After a period of intense concentration, and working with materials that fully engage their interest, children appear to be refreshed and contented. Through continued concentrated work of their own choice, children grow in inner discipline and peace. She called this process normalization and cited it as “the most important single result of our whole work.”
            <br /><br />
Normalization describes the process that takes place in Montessori classrooms around the world. There are young children, who typically have a short attention span, learn to focus their intelligence, concentrate their energies for long periods of time, and take tremendous satisfaction from their work.
            <br /><br />
In his book, Maria Montessori: Her Life and Work, E.M. Standing described the following characteristics of normalization in children ages of three to six:</p>
            <ul>
    <li>A love of order.</li>
    <li>A love of work.</li>
    <li>Profound spontaneous concentration.</li>
    <li>Attachment to reality.</li>
    <li>Love of silence and of working alone.</li>
    <li>Sublimation of the possessive instinct.</li>
    <li>Obedience.</li>
    <li>Independence and initiative.</li>
    <li>Spontaneous self-discipline.</li>
    <li>Joy.</li>
    <li>The power to act from real choice and not just from idle curiosity.</li>
    </ul>
        <p>
As they grow, Montessori children, given a free and beneficial environment, learn to approach challenges with gusto and find true joy in acquiring knowledge. It is not the work of the teacher but the other students and class as a whole result in a child being normalized. Without a large percentage of already normalized children setting the culture of the class, this is difficult to achieve. Previous Montessori experience is critical in a new elementary-level Montessori school. 
            </p>


<span class="SAPMSSubHeader">My Family Has No Prior Montessori Experience </span>
        <p>
SAPMS will have to grow responsibly, making certain to provide sufficient resources to students, their families, and the School’s faculty and staff. With no public Montessori schools in the County, only a small percentage of families have the resources to send their children to private Montessori programs. We see SAPMS as an option for all families interested in a Montessori education and are committed to bringing Montessori public.
            <br /><br />
The Montessori pedagogy is different from a traditional classroom, in part because it builds on students’ Montessori-specific experience year after year. Therefore, the method of ramping up a Montessori school is slightly more complicated than a ramp-up program for a more traditional school. Montessori experts agree that it can be challenging for most children beyond second or third grade if they have not had previous exposure to Montessori.
            <br /><br />
When a family without Montessori experience considers SAPMS, they should consider that a child with the following qualities would be the most likely to succeed in the learning environment of the Montessori program: </p>
        <ul>
<li>Passion for learning.</li>
<li>Self-motivation. </li>
<li>Willingness to investigate and take risks. </li>
<li>Enjoyment in choosing among several options.</li>
<li>A self-directed learner. </li>
<li>Ability to work independently.</li>
<li>Ability to follow through and complete tasks. </li>
<li>Respect for self, the environment, and others. </li>
<li>An awareness of personal responsibility. </li>
<li>Ability to work with others.</li>
<li>Honesty. </li>
<li>Respect for personal and academic endeavors. </li>
        </ul>

<span class="SAPMSSubHeader">Parent Commitment </span>
        <p>
Families of eligible children must be willing to make an extra commitment to their child's education. The Montessori school program is based on cooperative learning that involves family and community spirit. By signing the SAPMS Partnership Agreement, which includes a requirement of at least 20 hours of participation per year from each family and an agreement that they will follow our policies as outlined in the Community Handbook, parents or guardians show their commitment to the school’s mission and educational philosophy.

    <p>To maintain the Montessori philosophy in the classroom, SAPMS limits the number of students who do not have previous Montessori.  If the number of applicants exceeds capacity, SAPMS gives preference to those children with previous Montessori experience.   The desired ratio is four children with Montessori experience for every one child without Montessori experience.</p>
    <p>SAPMS wishes to grow the classes such that a majority of the students have previous Montessori education.  This allows minimal disruption to children who will remain in the same classroom for the three-year cycle. Our projections show 48 students for the 2013-14 school year.</p>
    <p>Since these numbers are projections, actual total and grade-level enrollment numbers possibly will be slightly higher or lower.</p>

    Preference for Children with Prior Montessori Experience
    </span>
    <p>Many public schools implementing Montessori programs struggle with admission criteria. Experience shows it can be challenging for children to transition into a Montessori-style teaching method if they are older and have become more accustomed to the more traditional educational approach. </p>
    <p>Montessori classes work very differently depending on the percentage of children with Montessori experience. Some children without Montessori preschool experience adapt easily to expectations in the Montessori elementary class and some do not. </p>
    <p>When children who cannot work independently are in the minority, the teacher can focus attention, use older children as tutors, and so on. When this group makes up the majority of the class, Montessori practices involving free choice for major portions of the day are hard to implement, at least early in the school year.</p>
    <p>SAPMS will limit the number of students who do not have previous Montessori experience as a means to maintaining the Montessori philosophy. The School will attempt to keep a ratio of four children with Montessori experience for every one child without Montessori experience in each classroom.  Montessori teachers have observed that having a higher percentage of new students without previous Montessori experience in a class can make the class more difficult to normalize according the Dr. Montessori’s definition of the term.</p>

    <span class="FAQQuestion">
    Normalization
    </span>
    <p>In the Montessori classroom the term normalized refers to special characteristics that Maria Montessori observed when children were allowed to work freely in a prepared environment. The North American Montessori Teacher’s Association describes it as follows:</p>
    <p class="QuoteDiv" style="width:auto;">Dr. Montessori observed that when children are allowed freedom in an environment suited to their needs, they blossom. After a period of intense concentration, and working with materials that fully engage their interest, children appear to be refreshed and contented. Through continued concentrated work of their own choice, children grow in inner discipline and peace. She called this process normalization and cited it as “the most important single result of our whole work.”</p>
    <p>Normalization describes the process that takes place in Montessori classrooms around the world.  There are young children, who typically have a short attention span, learn to focus their intelligence, concentrate their energies for long periods of time, and take tremendous satisfaction from their work.</p>
    <p>In his book, <i>Maria Montessori: Her Life and Work</i>, E.M. Standing described the following characteristics of normalization in  children ages of three to six:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A love of order.</li>
        <li>A love of work.</li>
        <li>Profound spontaneous concentration.</li>
        <li>Attachment to reality.</li>
        <li>Love of silence and of working alone.</li>
        <li>Sublimation of the possessive instinct.</li>
        <li>Obedience.</li>
        <li>Independence and initiative.</li>
        <li>Spontaneous self-discipline.</li>
        <li>Joy.</li>
        <li>The power to act from real choice and not just from idle curiosity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As they grow, Montessori children, given a free and beneficial environment, learn to approach challenges with gusto and find true joy in acquiring knowledge. It is not the work of the teacher but the other students and class as a whole result in a child being normalized.  Without a large percentage of already normalized children setting the culture of the class, this is difficult to achieve.  Previous Montessori experience is critical in a new elementary-level Montessori school.  </p>

    <span class="FAQQuestion">
    My Family Has No Prior Montessori Experience
    </span>
    <p>SAPMS will have to grow responsibly, making certain to provide sufficient resources to students, their families, and the School’s faculty and staff.  With no public Montessori schools in the County, only a small percentage of families have the resources to send their children to private Montessori programs. We see SAPMS as an option for all families interested in a Montessori education and are committed to bringing Montessori public.</p>
    <p>The Montessori pedagogy is different from a traditional classroom, in part because it builds on students’ Montessori-specific experience year after year. Therefore, the method of ramping up a Montessori school is slightly more complicated than a ramp-up program for a more traditionalschool. Montessori experts agree that it can be challenging for most children beyond second or third grade if they have not had previous exposure to Montessori.</p>
    <p>When a family without Montessori experience considers SAPMS, they should consider that a child with the following qualities would be the most likely to succeed in the learning environment of the Montessori program: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Passion for learning.</li>
        <li>Self-motivation. </li>
        <li>Willingness to investigate and take risks. </li>
        <li>Enjoyment in choosing among several options.</li>
        <li>A self-directed learner. </li>
        <li>Ability to work independently.</li> 
        <li>Ability to follow through and complete tasks. </li>
        <li>Respect for self, the environment, and others. </li>
        <li>An awareness of personal responsibility. </li>
        <li>Ability to work with others.</li>
        <li>Honesty. </li>
        <li>Respect for personal and academic endeavors. </li>
    </ul>

    <span class="FAQQuestion">
    Parent Committment
    </span>
    <p>Families of eligible children must be willing to make an extra commitment to their child's education. The Montessori school program is based on cooperative learning that involves family and community spirit. By signing the SAPMS Partnership Agreement, which includes a requirement of at least 20 hours of participation per year from each family and an agreement that they will follow our policies as outlined in the Community Handbook, parents or guardians show their commitment to the school’s mission and educational philosophy. </p>
