The St. Augustine Montessori Community Board is very happy to announce that the Founding Director of St. Augustine Public Montessori School will be Judi Dunlap. Judi’s 30-year career in Montessori education and leadership skills in both private and public Montessori Elementary schools meets and exceeds all of our expectations for this challenging position. <br />
<br />
“As a lifelong Montessori educator, I believe passionately in the power of the method to motivate and educate students. . . . Presenting our curriculum as an integrated spiral gives students the opportunity to revisit and refine concepts and understanding. The Montessori learning environment is one that is safe for risk taking and invites a sharing of ideas.” – Judi Dunlap <br />
<br />
Judi earned her BS in Individual and Family Studies at Penn State University and her MA in Gifted Education from the University of South Florida. She is certified by the American Montessori Society for ages 6-12 Elementary and by the National Center for Montessori Education for ages 2-6. She completed her elementary training at the Institute for Advanced Montessori Studies and has earned Florida Directors Credential. She is eligible for a FL teaching certificate (K-6), which will include gifted endorsement. <br />
<br />
Judi served as Principal of the Key West Montessori Elementary Charter School, was Elementary Dean at New Gate School in Sarasota, was Lead Teacher and started both the Lower and Upper Elementary programs at Palm Harbor Montessori Academy, and currently serves as Director and Upper Elementary Teacher at Montessori by the Sea in Pass-a-Grill Beach. She has also worked as a Montessori teacher trainer with Montessori Live and the Seacoast Center for Teacher Education, and has worked as a Montessori consultant for schools throughout Florida and nationally. <br />
<br />
Judi has a great interest in public Montessori’s ability to broaden and increase the availability of Montessori education. She would like to see a Montessori education available to every family who wants it. She believes it is possible to provide an authentic Montessori program in a charter school setting and has experience aligning the Florida State Standards with the Montessori curriculum. <br />
<br />
“Montessori education is a viable alternative to conventional schools. If we want to prepare children to master the demands of the 21st century, we have to educate the whole child. Montessori education provides practice with independence, time management, critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and conflict resolution. Children need a school that cultivates confidence and respect for themselves, others, and the environment.” – Judi Dunlap<br />
