    <span class="FAQQuestion">What is Montessori?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">The Montessori educational approach was developed by Dr. Maria Montessori, Italy’s first female physician. The Montessori Method was brought to the United States 100 years ago and is now used in 4,000 schools, including 400 public schools nationwide. Research shows that children who receive a Montessori education excel not only academically, but socially. Montessori teaches independence, problem-solving, responsibility, social courtesy, and good citizenship. Montessori honors and cultivates each child’s natural love of learning.</span>

    <span class="FAQQuestion">How is Montessori different?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">The elementary-aged child wants to know everything about everything. This natural tendency to learn with an expansive perspective within disciplines such as the sciences, the arts, and social studies, motivates basic skill mastery in the Montessori Elementary classroom. Children in a Montessori classroom learn from each other and because of each other. They develop skills of cooperation and respect. They collaborate instead of compete. They celebrate each other's efforts. They take care of themselves, they take care of others and they take care of their environment.</span>
    
    <span class="FAQQuestion">How are classes taught?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">SAPMS’s elementary program includes ten key curricular areas: Language Arts, Mathematics and Geometry, Geography, Earth and Physical Science, Biology, History/Social Science, the Arts (Visual Arts, Music, Drama, Movement), Character and Peace Education (Service Learning), Practical Life, and Health and Physical Education. SAPMS’s curriculum is designed to address the psychological characteristics of the elementary-aged child, which include a stronger capability of effort and concentration, an immense desire for knowledge, a stronger need to satisfy intellectual curiosity, development of the powers of imagination, and heightened social exploration.</span>

    <span class="FAQQuestion">Why a PUBLIC Montessori school?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">Montessori education is designed to teach peace and understanding among all people of all backgrounds and abilities, just like traditional public schools. We believe that an ideal Montessori classroom environment is one that is open to a diverse group of children, not just to those who can afford it. There are already 26 public Montessori elementary schools operating in Florida.</span>
    
    <span class="FAQQuestion">What is a charter school?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">A charter school is a public school that has received approval from the local School District and the State Department of Education to teach children using a different approach than the traditional classroom. The state and federal governments have decided to allow the use of alternative approaches in hopes that every child will be educated to reach his or her true potential.</span>

    -->
    <span class="FAQQuestion">Will SAPMS students be required to take standardized tests?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">Yes. Charter schools must meet the Florida Standards and test their students using the state-mandated test. The learning objectives of the Montessori elementary curriculum meet or exceed Florida and national curriculum guides. Charter schools are accountable to the federal/state government and to their authorizing School District for reporting standards achievement and compliance with Charter School laws and regulations. For those interested in 2014 FCAT test scores and the associated School Grades, this table lists the results from the State of Florida Department of Education for grades three through six for St. Augustine Public Montessori School and other St. Johns County Schools. See 2013-14 School Grade and Test Scores <a href="http://doeweb-prd.doe.state.fl.us/eds/nclbspar/year1213/nclb1213.cfm?dist_schl=55_12">here</a>.   </span>
        
    <span class="FAQQuestion">How many students will the school accommodate?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">Our current enrollment (2014-15) is 60 students in first to sixth grades.  We plan to grow to serve about 120-150 students in first through sixth grades. The actual number of students will depend on funding, facilities, applications received, and personnel hired.</span>
    
    <span class="FAQQuestion">Why does SAPMS start in First Grade, not Kindergarten?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">Since the Montessori Method recognizes the three-year developmental age spans observed by Dr. Montessori (Ages 3-6, 6-9, 9-12, and 12-15), if we are to be true to Montessori, a class made up of a single age level is not appropriate, nor is it appropriate to lump in Kindergartners with first through third graders.</span>

    <span class="FAQQuestion">Is Montessori for all children? What kind of student will do well in Montessori?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">
    Montessori education has been used successfully with children of all income levels, of all academic abilities, and from all cultural backgrounds. A child with the following qualities would be the most likely to succeed in the learning environment of the Montessori program:<br />

    <span class="FAQQuestion">Do Montessori students have priority?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">Yes, children with Montessori experience have priority. We will aim for a ratio of four previous Montessori students to one without.</span>

    <span class="FAQQuestion">What sort of parent involvement is expected?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">Families of eligible children must commit to their child’s education by agreeing to at least 20 hours a year of participation in the school and community. Parent activities will take many shapes and forms, such as attending school events, chaperoning, assisting teachers or in the office, coordinating PTO events, and so forth.</span>

    -->
    <span class="FAQQuestion">How much money will be needed to open and operate the school?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">
        Approximately $60,000 in donations is needed each year to operate the school until a facility is developed to accommodate our eventual 120-150 students.  This funding will come from private donations and grants.</span>

    <span class="FAQQuestion">Isn’t State funding provided to Charter Schools?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">Charter School funding is dependent on State Department of Education FTE (per pupil) funding and is set by the state legislature. The FTE funding is annual funding and does not cover the costs to operate a Montessori school.</span>
