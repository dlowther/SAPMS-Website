    <span class="FAQQuestion">Elementary Teacher</span>
    <br />
    A new elementary Montessori charter school, St. Augustine Public Montessori School (SAPMS) is accepting applications for Teachers.  SAPMS will open August 2012, eventually serving a 1-6 grade population of approximately 150 students.  SAPMS is a charter school affiliated with the St. Johns County School District.  The Teacher will be selected and supervised by the Founding Director, who is accountable to the school’s Board of Trustees of St. Augustine Montessori Community, Inc.  We are searching for an experienced teacher who models Montessori philosophy.  Candidates should be Montessori certified for the Elementary classroom, and be licensed or eligible to hold a valid FL teaching certification. 
    <br /><br />
    The job of the Montessori teacher is to follow each child’s progress, to create an environment where materials are available to the students and presented when they are ready to progress, and to encourage children to complete each phase of their work. Montessori teachers are charged with meeting the students’ physical, mental, and emotional needs, with designing individual and group learning opportunities, and with extensively documenting students’ progress and activities. Ultimately, Montessori teachers support their students in ways that lead the children toward their own successes.
    <br /><br />
    For the first few years of the school’s opening, the SAPMS Director also will serve as the lead teacher.  Teachers will hold, at minimum, 4-year liberal arts degrees, and will have Montessori training.  All SAPMS teachers must comply with the teaching requirements for Florida Charter Schools.  They must understand and believe in the Montessori philosophy and materials and be familiar with individualized observation and record keeping.  SAPMS teachers will be inquisitive, reflective, creative problem solvers who committed to the School’s mission.
    <br /><br />
    The teacher serves as a facilitator and guide in the Montessori classroom and is responsible for the functioning of the learning environment and all aspects of its day-to-day operations. He or she works with the Director, and as necessary, the Board of Directors, the District, students, parents, community members, and the other governing bodies specified by local and state law. 
    <br /><br />
    The teacher’s major areas of responsibility include the following: 
    <ul>
        <li>Preparing the Montessori classroom environment to meet the students’ needs and interests.</li>
        <li>Understanding and promoting the school’s vision, mission, and goals to students, parents, and community. </li>
        <li>Working with the community of administrators, teachers, parents, students, and board of directors, in articulating and maintaining the integrity and scope of the Montessori Method.</li>
        <li>Presenting consistent individual and group lessons to the students and supporting each child’s direction and success. </li>
        <li>Meeting regularly with students to work with them in assessing their own success and facilitating an individual path of progress. </li>
        <li>Working with students of varying abilities assigned to the classroom, including identifying those that might need further screening for ESE, providing support to those with learning difficulties as diagnosed, as well as attending meetings to support children who require it. </li>
        <li>Maintaining student records, reports, evaluations, inventories, and tests. </li>
        <li>Participating in field trips and overnights. </li>
        <li>Attending Board meetings, committee meetings, and any other meetings relevant to teaching at SAPMS as necessary. </li>
        <li>Continuing professional development and participating in recommended conferences, training programs, courses, and other areas of professional growth.</li>
    </ul>
    Interested candidates should provide a letter of intent, curriculum vitae, statement of educational philosophy, and two letters of recommendation. Please send material electronically to <a href="mailto:jean@staugustinemontessori.com">jean@staugustinemontessori.com</a>.
