    <span class="FAQAnswer">Dr. Montessori observed that every child has an intuitive goal of self-development, and it was only necessary to give him or her useful tools to accomplish learning. Her materials allow just that. Each child in the Montessori classroom moves at his or her own pace, and is not rushed through concepts. The Montessori Materials are self-correcting, and a child is permitted to use each material as long as and as many times as s/he wishes until a concept is mastered. And, because the children are not all working on the same thing at the same time, they are each focused on their own work, not on comparisons with neighboring students. A child is able to perform the work with minimum interference from the adult and therefore receives the ultimate satisfaction of self-accomplishment.</span>-->
    <!--<span class="FAQQuestion">How will a child with limited English language skills do in Montessori?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">Montessori, with its color-coded, sequential materials, can help these students progress while they are improving their English.</span>

    <span class="FAQQuestion">How do gifted children do in the Montessori classroom?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">In Montessori, gifted children stay engaged in learning and do not become bored, because each child in the Montessori classroom works at her own pace, and is never rushed or held back due to the abilities of classmates. A Montessori teacher would facilitate a child to ‘move ahead’ in areas in which she excels, even teaching peers.  A parent must consider not only their child’s intelligence level, but also her learning style – some gifted students do still require a more direct-instruction approach.</span>

    <span class="FAQQuestion">I always thought we had good schools here -- what’s wrong with the Saint Johns County School District’s schools?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">Nothing. St. Johns County has excellent traditional public schools and talented, dedicated teachers. A charter school simply offers a different instructional approach from a traditional classroom. Many children do not learn well, or as well as they could, in a traditional classroom, where most students are doing the same task and studying the same concepts at the same time. Teachers can’t always allow a student to move far beyond the contents of the chapter in the book being studied or the grade level’s standard curriculum. Other students may be swept along faster than they should be to grasp the material to go on to the next unit with everyone else. If we are to successfully educate every child, we need to have alternatives.</span>

    <span class="FAQQuestion">Don’t charter schools take money away from public schools?</span>
    <span class="FAQAnswer">No.  Charter schools are public schools. The federal government has set aside federal competitive grant funds to cover the start-up expenses for charter schools approved by the State Department of Education.  About 40% of the schools applying for this funding received it last year.  Charter schools help to keep students inside their local district rather than enrolling in a private school.</span>
